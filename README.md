# Simon Game

A simple game of short-term memory skill invented by Ralph H Baer. The machine displays a series of lights in a pattern. The user of has to repeat the same pattern from memory. If the user successfully emulates the pattern, the number of lights flashed increases. Once the user fails to emulate the pattern, the game ends.

There have been several iterations of this game with several versions and variants launched since 1978.
